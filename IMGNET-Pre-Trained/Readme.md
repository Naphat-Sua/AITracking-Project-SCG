# ImageNet pre-trained models

ImageNet is an image database organized according to the WordNet hierarchy (currently only the nouns), 
in which each node of the hierarchy is depicted by hundreds and thousands of images. (cite: [http://www.image-net.org](http://www.image-net.org))

Models in Convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification with weights trained on ImageNet such as:

* Xception
* VGG16
* VGG19
* ResNet50
* InceptionV3

These models are supported in Keras and this example shows to use them
